## About the Project

The aim of the project is to implement a scalable solution for finding frequent itemsets, which has been applied to a movies' dataset. This kind of analysis is also known as 'market-basket analysis', which deals with combinations of items that occur together frequently in baskets. Apache Spark environment, which is an open-source analytics engine focused on speed, ease in use, and distributed system necessary to analyze massive data sets has been set up for this project, considering the large size of the analyzed dataset. The solution has been written through Python 3 using Google Colab for a better reproducibility of the results.


The IMDB dataset has been taken from Kaggle, available at: '''https://www.kaggle.com/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset
'''
It has been analyzed in order to find the actors and actresses, considered as 'items', who occur together more frequently in the 'baskets' of movies.
